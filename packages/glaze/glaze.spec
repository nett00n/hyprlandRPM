%changelog
* Sat Feb 28 2026 Vladimir nett00n Budylnikov <git@nett00n.org> - 7.1.0-%autorelease
- This release focuses on YAML maturity, networking reliability, container/generic behavior, and platform compatibility.
- > [!IMPORTANT]
- glz::generic now supports different underlying map types, but now defaults to a faster, ordered map, which preserves insertion order rather than sorting lexicographically. This ensures proper round tripping for unsorted JSON objects. See documentation for more details: https://stephenberry.github.io/glaze/generic-json
- YAML support received major hardening and coverage improvements, including parser correctness, conformance, roundtrip behavior, and generic integration.
