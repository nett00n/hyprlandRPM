"""Checksum pinning for remote upstream sources (BUG-0025).

`spectool -g -R` (stage-srpm.py) and the vendor download path (lib.vendor) both
pull a remote tarball and hand it straight to `rpmbuild -bs` / `cargo vendor`
with nothing checking what actually arrived -- a retagged upstream release, a
tampered mirror, or a truncated download becomes a published RPM with no
signal. This module is the single source of truth for "which remote files
does this package's build depend on" (`remote_sources`), plus the two halves
that use it:

- `record()` -- explicit, reviewed step (`make refresh-checksums`) that
  downloads a file once and pins its sha256 into the committed
  `sources.lock.yaml`.
- `verify()` -- read-only check run on every build (stage-srpm.py, the vendor
  download path) that a file already on disk matches its pinned hash.

Trust model is TOFU (trust-on-first-use): the lock proves the bytes have not
changed since the hash was first recorded and reviewed in a diff, not that
upstream was honest at record time. Signature verification is out of scope
here -- see docs/todo.md.
