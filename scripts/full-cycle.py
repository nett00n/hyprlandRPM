"""Full build cycle orchestrator: spec → srpm → mock → copr.

Delegates each stage to the appropriate stage-*.py script, then
prints a summary table. All state is recorded in build-report.db.

Must be run inside the rpm toolbox container (invoked via Makefile).

Environment variables:
  FEDORA_VERSION             Fedora version to target (default: 43)
  MOCK_CHROOT                Override mock chroot (default: fedora-{FEDORA_VERSION}-x86_64)
  COPR_REPO                  Copr repo slug, e.g. nett00n/hyprland (optional)
  PACKAGE                    Build only this package (optional, comma-separated)
  SKIP_PACKAGES              Skip these packages (optional, comma-separated)
  PROCEED_BUILD              If 'true', skip stages already succeeded; preserve prior state
  FORCE_REBUILD              If '1'/'true', ignore the cache and re-run every stage
                              (spec through copr) for the requested PACKAGE(s) -- or every

                              affected packages. Deps pulled in transitively still respect
                              the cache; use `make build-pop` for a mock/copr-only force.
  SKIP_MOCK                  If 'true', skip mock build stage
  SKIP_COPR                  If 'true', skip copr submission stage
  SYNCHRONOUS_COPR_BUILD     If 'true', wait for COPR builds; default is async (--nowait)
  REQUIRE_CHROOT_COVERAGE    If 'true', block Copr submission instead of warning when a
                             chroot has no verified local mock build (see docs/bugs.md
                             BUG-0018). Default: warn and submit anyway.
  LOG_LEVEL                  Logging level: DEBUG, INFO (default), WARNING, ERROR
