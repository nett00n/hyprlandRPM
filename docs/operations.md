# Operations — maintainer runbook

Day-to-day running of the pipeline. For adding a package as a contributor, see
`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`. For `packages.yaml` schema details, see `docs/packaging.md`.

## Local build workflow

```shell
make stage-spec  PACKAGE=<name>                      # regenerate the spec file
make stage-srpm  PACKAGE=<name>                       # download sources, build SRPM
make stage-mock  PACKAGE=<name> FEDORA_VERSION=43     # test-build in mock
```

Or run stages individually and compose a custom pipeline:

```shell
make stage-validate PACKAGE=<name>   # validate packages.yaml entry
make stage-spec      PACKAGE=<name>
make stage-vendor    PACKAGE=<name>   # Go/Rust: generates vendor tarball (no-op otherwise)
make stage-srpm      PACKAGE=<name>
make stage-mock      PACKAGE=<name> FEDORA_VERSION=43
make stage-copr       PACKAGE=<name> COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland

make stage-validate stage-spec stage-vendor stage-srpm stage-mock PACKAGE=<name>  # skip copr
```

`PACKAGE`/`PKG` (either name works, case-insensitive) selects one package; unset builds all.
When set, `full-cycle` automatically pulls in transitive build dependencies and orders them
topologically.

### `full-cycle` flags

```shell
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> FEDORA_VERSION=43                          # spec→vendor→srpm→mock→copr
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> PROCEED_BUILD=true                          # resume, skip already-succeeded stages
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> SKIP_MOCK=true                              # stop after srpm
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> SKIP_COPR=true                              # test locally, don't push
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland SYNCHRONOUS_COPR_BUILD=true  # wait for COPR
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland REQUIRE_CHROOT_COVERAGE=true # block submit on chroot gaps
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> FORCE_REBUILD=1                             # ignore cache, rebuild spec→copr
```

Copr submission runs as its own pass, only after every package in the run has gone through
`mock` — if any package's `mock` stage failed, **no package is submitted**, so a healthy package
never publishes while a sibling in the same dependency set is broken. By default COPR builds are
submitted with `--nowait` (async); `SYNCHRONOUS_COPR_BUILD=true` waits for completion instead.

Before submitting, `full-cycle`/`stage-copr` also print a per-chroot local-mock coverage table
(queried from the Copr project's actual chroot list): each chroot is `verified` (this package's
local mock succeeded for it), `failed`, `unbuilt` (same arch, never tried locally), or `not
verifiable locally` (aarch64 — mock can't cross-build here, see `docs/todo.md` TODO-0024). By
default this only warns and still submits; `REQUIRE_CHROOT_COVERAGE=true` blocks the submission
instead whenever a same-arch chroot is `failed`/`unbuilt` (an aarch64 gap alone never blocks —
there is no local way to close it yet).

### Building every chroot locally before submitting

A single `full-cycle` run only builds one `FEDORA_VERSION`'s x86_64 chroot, but Copr fans a
submission out to every chroot configured on the project (fedora-43/44/rawhide x86_64/aarch64
for `nett00n/hyprland`) — a chroot-specific failure (e.g. a newer libstdc++ needed than an older
Fedora ships) can pass local mock and still fail on Copr (see `docs/bugs.md` BUG-0018). To catch
that before submitting:

```shell
make container-all                                                    # build images for all SUPPORTED versions once
make full-cycle-matrix PACKAGE=<name> COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland       # build every MATRIX_VERSIONS chroot locally, then submit once
make full-cycle-matrix PACKAGE=<name> MATRIX_VERSIONS="43 44"          # limit to specific versions
```

This loops `full-cycle FEDORA_VERSION=<v> SKIP_COPR=true` per `MATRIX_VERSIONS` (default: every
`SUPPORTED` version), then submits to Copr exactly once — Copr already fans one SRPM out to all
its own chroots, so submitting per version would create duplicate builds. aarch64 chroots are
still not covered by this (no cross-arch build path locally yet).

### Check build logs

`logs/build/<name>/`: `00-spec`/`10-srpm`/`20-mock`/`21-mock-build`/`21-mock-root` are local
stages. `30-copr` is the Copr submission (and, with `SYNCHRONOUS_COPR_BUILD=true`, the watched
result). On a Copr failure, `30-copr-chroots.log` (per-chroot states) and
`31-copr-<chroot>.log` (downloaded builder logs for the chroots that failed) are fetched
automatically — useful for an aarch64-only failure, which `make full-cycle-matrix` still can't
reproduce locally (see `docs/bugs.md` BUG-0018).

On failure, analyze logs for actionable errors:

```shell
make stage-log-analyze PACKAGE=<name>
```

Reports missing dependencies, incompatible plugins, missing source files, compile errors with
line references, unsatisfiable buildroot transactions (e.g. a stale `local-repo` RPM pinned
against a soname the current buildroot no longer provides — see `clean-mock-cache`/
`clean-localrepo` above), and (for Copr) which chroots failed vs. succeeded.

Most of that class of failure is now caught earlier: `stage-mock` preflights each package's
local deps before invoking mock at all (see "local-repo layout" below), failing in seconds
instead of after a multi-minute dnf5 resolution failure. `SKIP_REPO_PREFLIGHT=1` overrides it.

## Submitting to Copr

```shell
make full-cycle PACKAGE=<name> COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland-extras   # full pipeline + submit
make stage-copr PACKAGE=<name> COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland-extras   # submit only, after a local build
```

Requires `copr-cli` configured with `~/.config/copr`.

## Build cache and forcing a re-run

`full-cycle` skips stages whose inputs haven't changed (hash-based caching). Three ways to
force a re-run, from broadest to narrowest:

```shell
make full-cycle PACKAGE=hyprland FORCE_REBUILD=1   # this run: force spec→vendor→srpm→mock→copr
                                                    # for hyprland only; its deps stay cached
                                                    # unless their own inputs changed
make build-pop PKG=hyprland,waybar                 # persistent: force mock+copr next full-cycle
make build-pop PKG=""                              # force ALL packages (asks for confirmation)
```

`FORCE_REBUILD=1` is scoped to the package(s) named in `PACKAGE` (all packages if `PACKAGE` is
unset) and only applies to that one invocation — it does not write anything to
`build-report.db` beyond the normal stage rows for the run that just happened. It takes
precedence over `PROCEED_BUILD` for the packages it applies to (a warning is printed if both are
set). Note: `stage-vendor`'s tarball-exists short-circuit means `FORCE_REBUILD` still reuses an
already-generated vendor tarball for the same version instead of re-vendoring — harmless (same
content, content-addressed), but if a genuinely fresh vendor tree is needed, delete the tarball
by hand first.

`make build-pop` sets `force_run` on the mock/copr rows in `build-report.db`; the next
`full-cycle` picks it up and clears it (one-shot) — use this to force only mock+copr, or when
the force needs to persist into a later invocation that won't itself pass `FORCE_REBUILD`.
For a stage other than mock/copr, use `db-shell` directly:

```shell
make db-shell
sqlite> UPDATE stage_results SET force_run = 1
        WHERE package = 'hyprland' AND stage = 'spec' AND target = 'fedora-44-x86_64';
```

Rules:
- Forcing any stage forces it and all downstream stages (spec → vendor → srpm → mock → copr).
- If a `depends_on` dependency was rebuilt (not cached) in the current run, all stages of the
  dependent package are forced too.
- `force_run` is cleared automatically after the stage runs, success or fail (one-shot).
- `reason` on each stage row explains why it was cached/skipped/forced (e.g. `"cached"`,
  `"hash-mismatch"`, `"forced (dep rebuilt: hyprutils)"`) — only lists deps that actually
  changed.
- The vendor stage is special-cased: whether a package has a vendor stage at all is decided
  from `packages.yaml` (`lib.vendor.needs_vendoring`) every run, never from a stored DB row.
  A non-Go/Rust package's vendor row always reads `reason="not-vendored"` and renders as `n/a`
  in the summary table and `docs/full-report.md` — it is never reported as `"cached"`.
- `make stage-<x>` (any single stage, standalone) clears that stage's `build-report.db` rows for
  the packages being built via `lib.yaml_utils.prepare_stage()`, unless `PROCEED_BUILD=true`.
  `full-cycle` never calls `prepare_stage()`, for any stage — those rows are the hash cache
  `is_cached()` reads, so clearing them there would force a full rebuild of every package on every
  run. Use `FORCE_REBUILD`/`make build-pop`/the `db-shell` recipe above to force a rebuild through
  `full-cycle` instead.

## Build report database

Build state lives in `build-report.db` (sqlite, gitignored), keyed by `(package, stage, target)`
— `target` is the mock chroot (e.g. `fedora-44-x86_64`), so a second Fedora version doesn't
overwrite the first. Three tables: `runs` (one row per invocation), `stage_results` (per-stage
state), `artifacts` (paths/sizes of build outputs). `make db-shell` opens an interactive sqlite3
shell.

Every SRPM, vendor tarball, and mock-built RPM (plus logs) is recorded in the `artifacts` table
as it's produced:

```shell
make db-usage              # disk usage by package × target
make db-prune               # dry-run: what would be removed (keeps newest per package/target/kind)
make db-prune CONFIRM=1     # actually delete
```

`db-prune` only prunes `srpm`/`rpm`/`vendor` — logs are untouched; use `make clean-logs` for
those. Both must run in-container (`CONTAINER_PYTHON`): recorded paths are container-absolute
and only resolve with the same volumes mounted.

`make clean-logs` clears `stage_results`/`runs` but keeps the artifact ledger — dropping it
would orphan every tracked file with no record of what it is. For a full wipe (irreversible,
asks for confirmation): `make db-nuke`.

## Container volumes

Per-`FEDORA_VERSION` named volumes persist state across the `--rm` containers every `make`
target runs in: `rpmbuild-<ver>` (SOURCES/SRPMS/RPMS) and `mock-cache-<ver>`/`mock-root-<ver>`
(mock's own `/var/cache/mock` and `/var/lib/mock` — the bootstrapped buildroot and dnf package
cache). Without the last two, every `make full-cycle`/nightly run would re-bootstrap every
chroot from scratch; with them, only the first build after `container-volume-clean` pays that
cost, and it grows to roughly 1-1.5GB per Fedora version.

To reset just the mock cache (e.g. it's resolving against a package that no longer matches
what's actually installable):

```shell
make clean-mock-cache FEDORA_VERSION=44   # drop mock-cache-44/mock-root-44 only
```

`make container-volume-clean` removes both volumes for one (or, from the default
`FEDORA_VERSION`, every `SUPPORTED`) version — use it for a full reset, e.g. after a mock/dnf
upgrade in the base image.

### local-repo layout

`local-repo/` — the dnf repo `stage-mock` builds from locally-built RPMs, so mock can resolve
one package's `depends_on` against another's output — is a plain directory (not a volume),
scoped per chroot: `local-repo/<target>/` (e.g. `local-repo/fedora-44-x86_64/`). An RPM built
for one Fedora version can't be served into a different version's buildroot.

```shell
make clean-localrepo FEDORA_VERSION=44   # delete local-repo/fedora-44-x86_64/ + its ledger rows
```

`stage-mock` warns about any flat RPMs still sitting directly under `local-repo/` (pre-migration
leftovers, not served to mock) — remove with `rm -rf local-repo/*.rpm local-repo/repodata`.

## Regenerating docs

```shell
make readme   # regenerates README.md, docs/README.copr.md, docs/full-report.md
```

Renders from `build-report.db` via `scripts/gen-report.py` (`--format github|copr|full-report`).
By default it polls COPR for in-progress build status and updates the DB; `make readme` does
this only once (the GitHub README pass) and passes `--skip-copr-poll` for the other two, to
avoid redundant API calls.

### `repo.yaml` reference

Branding/layout config for generated docs -- name, logo, license, support links, badge style,
and (below) the News feed and per-section visibility. Package data itself comes from
`packages.yaml`/`build-report.db`, not this file.

```yaml
documents:
  badge_style: for-the-badge
  news_limit: 8          # how many blog/NEWS.md entries the README shows (default: 8)
  sections:               # per-block visibility in generated docs; unset keys default to true
    news: true
    docs: true
    support: true
    license: true
    authors: true
    maintainers: true
    contributors: true
    additional_info: true  # additional_info also still requires repo.bottom_info to be set
```

Every key under `sections` is independent -- e.g. set `contributors: false` to hide a broken
render (see `docs/bugs.md` BUG-0030) without touching the underlying git-log-based collection
logic. Omitting `documents.sections` entirely renders every block, same as today.

### CI docs-shell publish

`make readme` needs `build-report.db` (gitignored) to know which packages exist and their build
status -- CI starts with none, so it can't run `make readme` safely; doing so would render zero
packages and, if auto-committed, wipe the real README.

```shell
make readme-shell   # regenerate only the branding shell, no build-report.db needed
```

`scripts/gen-readme-shell.py` renders `__header.j2`/`__footer.j2` (logo, description, News,
Docs, Support, License, People) from `repo.yaml`/`blog/NEWS.md`/git log, and splices the result
into `README.md`/`docs/README.copr.md` between their existing `<!-- BEGIN: X -->`/
`<!-- END: X -->` markers -- everything between the header and footer (the packages table,
build status) is left exactly as committed. `docs/full-report.md` isn't touched at all; it's
build-data end to end and stays a `make readme`-local artifact.

`.github/workflows/publish-readme.yml` runs this on every push to `main` and on manual dispatch,
committing (`[skip ci]`, to avoid re-triggering itself) and pushing if anything changed. Safe by
construction: the script cannot touch the packages/build-status region, so there's no path to
an empty-package README landing on `main` even from a from-scratch checkout.

## `update-daily`

```shell
make update-daily COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland            # commit only
make update-daily COPR_REPO=nett00n/hyprland PUSH=1      # commit and push
```

Runs: bump versions → `validate-packages` + `fmt` (packages.yaml sanity/formatting only —
**not** the full `pre-commit` gate; `scripts/` lint/test health is already CI's job on every
push/PR, an unrelated regression there shouldn't block tonight's Copr publish) → full build
cycle → `validate-packages` again (no `fmt`) → regenerate docs → push COPR description →
`git commit`. The second `validate-packages` exists because `full-cycle.py`'s
`update_package_releases()` rewrites `packages.yaml`'s release fields *after* the first gate
ran, and that's the file the commit and the generated docs are built from (docs/bugs.md
BUG-0044); it skips `fmt` because the rewrite already goes through the same formatter `make
fmt` itself uses, so there's nothing left to reformat. Only stages `packages.yaml packages/
submodules/ README.md docs/README.copr.md docs/full-report.md` — the automation never touches
`templates/`/`blog/`, so hand-edits there are never swept into a daily commit. Intended to run
unattended from an external nightly cron (the repo itself has no scheduler); pass `PUSH=1` for
that.

**Concurrency:** `update-daily`, `full-cycle`, and `full-cycle-matrix` all take a shared
`flock` on `logs/.pipeline.lock` before doing any work. A second run started while one of
these is still in progress refuses immediately with an error naming the holder (PID and start
time) and exits non-zero -- it never waits, so an overrunning nightly job shows up as a loud
cron failure instead of a silent skip or a corrupted `build-report.db`/git state. This also
means a manual `make full-cycle` cannot run while the nightly job is still going. Bypass with
`LOCK_DISABLE=1` if you deliberately need overlapping runs (e.g. two disjoint `PACKAGE=`
scopes) or the host lacks `flock` (util-linux).

A one-off package build failure (e.g. a chroot-specific mock failure) does **not** abort the
run: it's recorded in `build-report.db` as usual, `readme`/`copr-description`/the docs commit
still happen (so the night's version bumps and submodule moves aren't lost), and
`update-daily` reports the failure and exits non-zero only at the very end, after everything
else has run. Check `logs/build/<pkg>` or run `make stage-log-analyze` to see what failed.

A no-op night (nothing staged) skips the commit instead of failing the target. With `PUSH=1`,
the target rebases onto `origin/main` before pushing, so it doesn't collide with
`publish-readme.yml`'s own `[skip ci]` push to `main`.

## Utility commands

**Download sources** (offline/debug):
```shell
make sources PACKAGE=<name>   # or omit PACKAGE for all
```

**Suggest `requires:` entries** from a built RPM's SONAME dependencies:
```shell
make gather-requires RPM=path/to/package.rpm
```

**Remove a package** entirely (`packages.yaml`, build logs, spec files, submodules, container
rpmbuild dirs):
```shell
make delete-package PACKAGE=<name>   # PKG=<name> also works
```

**Dev file server** for build artifacts (not wired into any Makefile target):
```shell
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/serve.py
```

## Logging

`LOG_LEVEL` env var on any script/stage: `DEBUG`, `INFO` (default), `WARNING`, `ERROR`,
`CRITICAL`.

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG make stage-validate PACKAGE=hyprland
```

### Stage event lines

Every stage transition (`RUN`/`OK`/`FAIL`/`SKIP`/`CHECK`) is printed as one self-contained
line via `lib.reporting.event()` (used internally by `status()`/`verbose_proceed_check()`) —
no multi-line banners, no state that only exists in an earlier line you've already scrolled
past:

```
2026-08-12T14:03:41-04:00	stage=mock	target=fedora-43-x86_64	pkg=hyprland	state=RUN	ver=0.52.1-1.fc43
2026-08-12T14:04:22-04:00	stage=mock	target=fedora-43-x86_64	pkg=hyprland	state=OK	ver=0.52.1-1.fc43	dur=41.2s
2026-08-12T14:04:23-04:00	stage=mock	target=fedora-44-x86_64	pkg=hyprland-devel	state=FAIL	reason=cached
```

Fields:
- Timestamp: RFC 3339, second precision, local offset.
- Tab-separated `key=value` pairs — `stage`, `target`, `pkg`, `state` always present;
  extra fields (`reason`, `ver`, `dur`, `prior`, `action`, ...) appended only when
  non-empty. `ver` (the NVR, e.g. `0.52.1-1.fc43`) is present on every spec/vendor/srpm/
  mock/copr line once the package's declared version is known; it's absent on
  `validate` lines and on the config-skip lines emitted before that lookup happens.
- `state` is colorized (RUN=yellow, OK=green, FAIL=red, SKIP=grey, CHECK=cyan) when stdout
  is a tty and `NO_COLOR` is unset; plain text otherwise, so redirected/piped output and
  log files never carry escape codes.
- `stage` is also colorized, one hue per stage (validate=blue, spec=magenta, vendor=cyan,
  srpm=bright blue, mock=bright magenta, copr=bright cyan) — separate from the state
  palette, so scanning a scrolling multi-target log for "just the mock lines" (or any
  other stage) is a color you can pick out without reading text.
- Through `make` (any target that runs `CONTAINER_RUN`), colors only appear if make's
  own stdout is a terminal — the Makefile passes `-t` to `podman`/`docker run`
  conditionally on that, since without it the container's stdout is always a plain
  pipe regardless of your outer terminal. `NO_COLOR` set on the host is forwarded into
  the container the same way `LOG_LEVEL` already is.
